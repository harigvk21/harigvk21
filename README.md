## Hello, I'm <a href="https://harigvk21.github.io/My_website/">Harikeshav GV</a>!
Cybersecurity professional

## Objective
I entered this field to understand the world of networking and security, so that I can contribute something back to the society that has been protecting us all this while.
My journey so far has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field from a marketing background, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
