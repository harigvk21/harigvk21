# Hello, I'm Hari! I'm a student of Networking and Cybersecurity!

## Objective

My journey so far in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. I entered this field to understand the world of networking and security, so that I can contribute something back to the society that has been protecting us all this while.
